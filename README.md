2. In the same terminal install react-router-dom, redux, and react-redux.
3. Also in the same terminal (terminal 1), type npm run server.

## Usage

(***Edit this section if you add back buttons, and an admin page***)

To use this application:

2. The user clicks next buttons to navigate through each input page until they arrive at a comments page where they can add text describing their learning experiences. 
3. The user clicks another next button and is brought to a review page where they can review their feedback.
4. The user then clicks a submit button to add their response to a database.
5. There is a final page which allows the user to restart the survey if they wish too.
